3. **Try the examples:**
   Each notebook is self-contained and includes sample data.

## üìã How to Use These Examples

### For Educators:
- **Start with notebook 1** to understand basic progress tracking
- **Use notebook 2** to learn message styling
- **Study notebook 3** for data validation patterns
- **Reference notebook 4** for complete workshop structure

### For Workshop Participants:
- Follow along with the notebooks during workshops
- Experiment with different parameters
- Try your own data and use cases
- Use as templates for your own projects

## üéØ Example Use Cases

These notebooks demonstrate patterns for:

### Technical Workshops
```python
from jupyter_lab_progress import LabProgress, show_info

# MongoDB workshops
progress = LabProgress([
    "Set up Atlas account",
    "Create cluster", 
    "Connect with Python",
    "Insert documents",
    "Create indexes"
])

show_info("Welcome to MongoDB Essentials! üçÉ")
```

### Data Science Labs
```python
from jupyter_lab_progress import LabValidator, show_warning

validator = LabValidator()

# Validate embeddings before training
if validator.check_embedding_shape(embeddings, 384):
    show_info("‚úÖ Embeddings ready for model training!")
else:
    show_warning("‚ùå Check your embedding dimensions")
```

### ML/AI Workshops
```python
# Track complex ML pipeline
ml_progress = LabProgress([
    "Data Collection",
    "Feature Engineering", 
    "Model Training",
    "Evaluation",
    "Deployment"
], title="ü§ñ ML Pipeline Progress")
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

All examples can be customized for your specific needs:

- **Change the steps** to match your workshop content
- **Modify validation rules** for your data requirements  
- **Update messages** with your branding
- **Add custom progress trackers** for complex workflows

## üí° Best Practices from Examples

### Progress Tracking
- Use descriptive step names
- Group related tasks
- Add checkpoints for long labs
- Show progress after each major step

### Display Messages
- Use `show_info()` for tips and success messages
- Use `show_warning()` for important notices
- Include emojis for visual appeal
- Keep messages concise but helpful

### Validation
- Validate early and often
- Provide clear error messages
- Use context parameters for debugging
- Create custom validators for complex checks
