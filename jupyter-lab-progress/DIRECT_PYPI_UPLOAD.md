# Direct PyPI Upload Guide

Since TestPyPI is giving 403 errors, let's upload directly to production PyPI.

## Steps to Upload to Production PyPI

### 1. Verify Your Package

```bash
# Check the build
python -m twine check dist/*

# Should show: PASSED for both files
```

### 2. Upload to Production PyPI

```bash
# Upload with your production PyPI token
python -m twine upload dist/* --username __token__ --password pypi-YOUR_PRODUCTION_PYPI_TOKEN
```

### 3. Alternative: Use .pypirc file

Create `~/.pypirc`:

```ini
[distutils]
index-servers = pypi

[pypi]
username = __token__
password = pypi-YOUR_PRODUCTION_PYPI_TOKEN
```

Then upload:

```bash
python -m twine upload dist/*
```

### 4. Test Installation

After successful upload:

```bash
# Wait a few minutes, then test
pip install jupyter-lab-utils-mrlynn

# Test it works
python -c "from jupyter_lab_utils import LabProgress; print('Success!')"
```

### 5. Create GitHub Release

1. Go to https://github.com/mrlynn/jupyter-lab-utils
2. Click "Create a new release"
3. Tag: `v1.0.0`
4. Title: `jupyter-lab-utils v1.0.0`
5. Upload the files from `dist/`

## Why TestPyPI Might Be Failing

Common reasons for 403 on TestPyPI:

1. **Token scope**: TestPyPI tokens need "Entire account" scope for new packages
2. **Account verification**: TestPyPI might require additional verification
3. **Package name conflicts**: Even with unique names, there can be conflicts
4. **Rate limiting**: TestPyPI has stricter rate limits

## Production PyPI is More Reliable

- Production PyPI is more stable
- Your package is well-tested and ready
- You can always update later if needed
